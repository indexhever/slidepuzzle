# Slide Puzzle Game

This project is an implementation of a simple [Slide Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle), in which you touch on a piece and an empty space to move the piece to that space. Using this mechanic, the player finishes the game when all pieces are in correct order.

All the development process was made using [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), following Clean Code guidelines and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles. Each test can be found on [Test folder](https://github.com/indexhever/slidepuzzle/tree/master/Assets/Tests).
